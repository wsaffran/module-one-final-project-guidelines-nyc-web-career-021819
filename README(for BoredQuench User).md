##BoredQuench ReadMe

Are you bored? We feel ya.

Luckily for you, we've decided to create BoredQuench, a work of sheer brilliance designed to assuage the endless onslaught of boredom you experience on a daily basis.

It's super easy to get started. If you've visited us before, just enter in your username - it can be any combination of letters and numbers, but please do remember to keep it case-sensitive.

Once you're in, you can see the list of activities you've done in the past, or browse for new ones.

Like an activity? Great. Hate an activity? Even better! Just let us know and we'll be able to tell other bored folks whether that activity has been popular in the past.

Once you feel sufficiently entertained, feel free to rate your activities and head out. We know that the crushing weight of boredom will strike you sometime in the near future, and we'll see you again soon :)

Love, Adam, Matt, and Will
